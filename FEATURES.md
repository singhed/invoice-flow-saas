- Quality assurance

**Example Audit Record:**
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "expense_id": 42,
  "suggested_category": "Travel",
  "suggested_notes": "Transportation to client site.",
  "was_accepted": true,
  "user_modified": true,
  "final_category": "Marketing & Advertising",
  "final_notes": "Transportation to client site.",
  "model_used": "gpt-4",
  "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z"
}
```

This shows:
- AI suggested "Travel" category
- User changed it to "Marketing & Advertising"
