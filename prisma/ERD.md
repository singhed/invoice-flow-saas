## Indexes

Performance-critical indexes have been added to:

- Foreign keys (userId, clientId, projectId, etc.)
- Status fields for filtering
- Date fields for time-based queries (startTime, dueDate, paymentDate, etc.)
- Boolean flags for filtering (invoiced, sent, isBillable)
- Unique constraints (email, invoiceNumber, userId+provider)

## Cascade Behaviors

### ON DELETE CASCADE
Most foreign key relationships use CASCADE delete to maintain referential integrity:
- Deleting a User cascades to all their owned entities
- Deleting a Client cascades to Projects and Invoices
- Deleting an Invoice cascades to InvoiceLineItems, Payments, and Reminders
- Deleting a Project cascades to TimeEntries

### ON DELETE SET NULL
Some optional relationships use SET NULL:
- Deleting a Project sets projectId to NULL in InvoiceLineItems
- Deleting an InvoiceLineItem sets invoiceLineItemId to NULL in TimeEntries

## Data Types

### String Fields
- All IDs use CUID (Collision-resistant Unique Identifier)
- Text fields are variable length
- Email addresses are validated at application level

### Decimal Fields
- Currency amounts: `Decimal(10,2)` - up to 99,999,999.99
- Tax rates: `Decimal(5,2)` - up to 999.99%
- Quantities: `Decimal(10,2)` - supports fractional quantities

### DateTime Fields
- All timestamps use PostgreSQL TIMESTAMP(3) for millisecond precision
- `createdAt` defaults to NOW()
- `updatedAt` automatically updates on record changes

### JSON Fields
- `Integration.config` stores provider-specific configuration
- Flexible schema for different integration requirements

## Migration Commands

### Development
```bash
# Create and apply migrations
npm run db:migrate

# Apply existing migrations
npm run db:migrate:deploy

# Generate Prisma Client
npm run db:generate

# Open Prisma Studio (database GUI)
npm run db:studio

# Seed database with sample data
npm run db:seed
```

### Production
```bash
# Apply migrations only (no prompts)
npm run db:migrate:deploy

# Generate Prisma Client
npm run db:generate
```

## Seed Data

The seed script (`prisma/seed.js`) creates sample data including:

- 2 users (Admin and regular User)
- 3 clients (Acme Corporation, TechStart Inc, Global Industries)
- 4 projects with varying statuses
- Multiple time entries across projects
- 3 invoices in different states (DRAFT, SENT, PAID)
- Invoice line items linking to projects
- 2 payments for invoices
- 3 expense categories and 4 expenses
- Multiple reminders for invoices
- 3 integrations (Stripe, QuickBooks, Slack)

Run the seed with: `npm run db:seed`

## Best Practices

1. **Always use transactions** for operations that modify multiple related entities
2. **Validate business logic** at the application level before database operations
3. **Use soft deletes** for important entities if audit trail is needed (add `deletedAt` field)
4. **Index frequently queried fields** - already implemented for common use cases
5. **Use Prisma Client** generated types for type-safe database operations
6. **Keep migrations in version control** - already set up in `prisma/migrations/`
7. **Test migrations** on staging before production deployment

## Security Considerations

1. **Password hashing**: Store `passwordHash`, never plain passwords
2. **Token storage**: Integration tokens should be encrypted at rest
3. **Access control**: Implement row-level security in application logic
4. **Input validation**: Validate all inputs before database operations
5. **Rate limiting**: Implement for authentication and API endpoints
6. **Audit logging**: Consider adding audit trail for sensitive operations

## Future Enhancements

Potential schema enhancements for future versions:

1. **Multi-tenancy**: Add `organizationId` for team/company isolation
2. **Recurring invoices**: Add template and schedule tables
3. **Documents**: Add table for storing contracts, proposals, etc.
4. **Comments/Notes**: Add commenting system for collaboration
5. **Email templates**: Store customizable email templates
6. **Webhooks**: Add webhook configuration and logs
7. **Audit log**: Comprehensive change tracking
8. **File attachments**: Dedicated table for file metadata
9. **Tax rules**: Complex tax calculation rules
10. **Multi-currency**: Support for multiple currencies

## Support

For questions or issues with the database schema:
1. Check Prisma documentation: https://www.prisma.io/docs/
2. Review migration files in `prisma/migrations/`
3. Use Prisma Studio for visual database inspection: `npm run db:studio`
