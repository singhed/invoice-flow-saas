# Next.js App Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully bootstrapped a production-ready Next.js 14 application with TypeScript, App Router, and full API client integration.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. ✅ Project Setup & Configuration
- Installed all required dependencies:
  - Tailwind CSS v3.4 (for styling)
  - Prettier (for code formatting)
  - Zod & @t3-oss/env-nextjs (for environment validation)
  - clsx & tailwind-merge (for className utilities)
- Configured Next.js with `next.config.mjs` (performance optimizations)
- Set up TypeScript with path aliases (`@/*`)
- Configured ESLint (Next.js defaults)
- Configured Prettier with Tailwind plugin

### 2. ✅ Performance Best Practices
Implemented in `next.config.mjs`:
- **Tree Shaking**: Automatic dead code elimination
- **SWC Minification**: Fast builds and optimized bundles
- **Image Optimization**: AVIF/WebP support with responsive sizes
- **Console Removal**: Production builds remove console logs
- **Package Import Optimization**: Optimized imports for better bundle sizes

### 3. ✅ Environment Configuration
- Created `src/env.mjs` with Zod validation
- Environment variables:
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` - Backend API base URL
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME` - Application name
  - `NODE_ENV` - Environment mode
- Runtime validation ensures type safety

### 4. ✅ Typed API Client
Created a fully typed API client in `src/lib/api/`:
- **`types.ts`**: Complete TypeScript types for all API responses
- **`client.ts`**: Typed API client functions:
  - `getHealth()` - Health check
  - `getHello()` - Hello endpoint
  - `getExpenses()` - List expenses with pagination
  - `getExpense(id)` - Get single expense
  - `createExpense()` - Create new expense
  - `updateExpense()` - Update expense
  - `deleteExpense()` - Delete expense
  - `getCategories()` - Get expense categories
  - `getAISuggestion()` - Get AI suggestions
- Error handling with custom `ApiClientError` class
- Environment-driven API base URL

### 5. ✅ Shared UI Components
Created reusable components in `src/components/ui/`:
- **Button**: Multi-variant button (primary, secondary, outline, danger)
- **Card**: Card components (Card, CardHeader, CardTitle, CardDescription, CardContent, CardFooter)
- **Loading**: Loading spinner with size variants
- **Navbar**: Application navigation with links

### 6. ✅ Routes Implementation

#### Home Page (`/`)
- Server component that fetches backend health status
- Displays connection status with visual indicator (green/red)
- Features overview cards
- Quick navigation to invoices
- Built with responsive Tailwind CSS styling

#### Invoices Page (`/invoices`)
- Server component that fetches expenses from API
- Displays expenses in a responsive grid layout
- Handles error states gracefully
- Shows empty state when no expenses exist
- Prepares for future backend implementation

### 7. ✅ Layout & Navigation
- Root layout with Navbar in `app/layout.tsx`
- Responsive navigation between Home and Invoices
- Dark theme with Tailwind CSS
- Proper metadata configuration

### 8. ✅ Scripts & Development Workflow
Package.json scripts:
- `dev` - Start development server
- `build` - Production build
- `start` - Start production server
- `lint` - ESLint validation
- `format` - Auto-format code with Prettier
- `format:check` - Check code formatting
- `type-check` - TypeScript validation

### 9. ✅ Documentation
- Created comprehensive `README.md` for the web app
- Included project structure, setup instructions, and development guidelines
- Documented API client usage

### 10. ✅ Git Configuration
- Created `.gitignore` with appropriate exclusions
- Created `.prettierignore` to skip generated files

## Technical Highlights

### Server Components
All pages use React Server Components by default for:
- Better performance (less JavaScript sent to client)
- Direct database/API access
- SEO benefits
- Reduced client bundle size

### Type Safety
- Full TypeScript coverage
- Zod validation for environment variables
- Typed API client with proper error handling
- No TypeScript errors or ESLint warnings

### Styling
- Tailwind CSS v3 with PostCSS
- Responsive design (mobile-first)
- Dark theme optimized
- Consistent design system with reusable components

### Performance
- Optimized Next.js configuration
- Image optimization enabled
- Tree shaking enabled
- Production console removal
- Fast refresh in development

## Verification

All checks passing:
- ✅ Build: `pnpm build` - Success
- ✅ Type Check: `pnpm type-check` - No errors
- ✅ Lint: `pnpm lint` - No warnings
- ✅ Format: `pnpm format` - All files formatted
- ✅ Dev Server: Starts successfully on port 3000

## Backend Integration

The application is configured to connect to the Go backend at:
- Default: `http://localhost:8080`
- Configurable via `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` environment variable

### Current Backend Endpoints Used:
- `GET /healthz` - Health check (implemented and working)

### Ready for Future Backend Endpoints:
- `GET /api/expenses` - List expenses
- `POST /api/expenses` - Create expense
- `PUT /api/expenses/:id` - Update expense
- `DELETE /api/expenses/:id` - Delete expense
- `GET /api/categories` - List categories
- `POST /api/expenses/ai-suggest` - AI suggestions

The typed API client is ready and will work as soon as these endpoints are implemented in the backend.

## Next Steps

To fully utilize the application:
1. Start the Go backend: `cd apps/api && go run ./cmd/api`
2. Start the Next.js frontend: `cd apps/web && pnpm dev`
3. Visit `http://localhost:3000`
4. The home page will show backend connectivity status
5. Navigate to `/invoices` to see the expenses interface

The application is production-ready and follows all Next.js and React best practices.
