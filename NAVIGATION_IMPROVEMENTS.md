# Navigation & Wayfinding Improvements - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes all improvements made to address the Navigation & Wayfinding issues identified in the UX Audit (Section 1.1).

## Issues Addressed

### ‚úÖ 1. Navbar Clutter (8+ navigation items)

**Before:**
- Flat navigation structure with all items at the same level
- No clear visual separation between different types of items
- Cluttered appearance with theme toggle, language switcher, and navigation mixed together

**After:**
- **Primary Navigation Section** (left side, separated by border):
  - Home
  - Invoices (only shown when authenticated)
  - Docs (external link)
  
- **Secondary Actions Section** (right side):
  - Theme Toggle
  - Language Switcher
  - User Account Menu (for authenticated users)
  - Sign in / Get started buttons (for non-authenticated users)

**Implementation Details:**
- Used visual dividers (border) to separate primary and secondary sections
- Reduced visible navigation items by grouping user actions in a dropdown
- Added icons (lucide-react) for better visual hierarchy
- Clear hover states and transitions

### ‚úÖ 2. Authentication State Reflected in Navigation

**Before:**
- Navigation showed the same items regardless of authentication state

**After:**

  - Dynamically adapts based on authentication state
  - Separate "Account" section with appropriate items

**Implementation Details:**
- Auth state checked from localStorage (`auth_token`)
- Conditional rendering based on `isAuthenticated` state
- Consistent behavior across desktop and mobile views

### ‚úÖ 3. Mobile-Responsive Navigation Menu

- Icons from lucide-react for consistency
- Proper focus states with ring effects

### ‚úÖ 5. Breadcrumb Navigation for Deeper Pages

**Before:**
