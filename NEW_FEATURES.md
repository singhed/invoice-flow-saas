## Architecture

### Service Communication

```
Frontend (Next.js)
    ↓
API Gateway (Port 3000)
    ↓
┌───────────────────────────────────┐
│                                   │
Invoice Service  Analytics Service  Search Service
  (Port 3001)      (Port 3007)      (Port 3008)
       ↓                ↓                ↓
   ┌────────────────────────────────────┐
   │         Redis Cache                │
   └────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Data Flow

1. **Analytics**: Aggregates data from invoice operations, caches results in Redis
2. **Search**: Indexes invoices in Redis, provides fast search and filtering
3. **Budget**: Tracks expenses, triggers alerts, generates reports
4. **Export**: Formats invoice data for external consumption
