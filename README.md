## 🧪 Testing

### Automated Testing with Retry Logic

The project includes comprehensive automated testing with built-in retry logic:

```bash
# Run complete test suite
bash scripts/test-runner.sh
```

The test runner automatically:
1. Validates Terraform configurations
2. Runs unit tests for all services
3. Executes integration tests
4. Validates Kubernetes manifests
5. Builds Docker images
6. Runs E2E tests
7. **Retries failed tests up to 3 times**
8. Generates detailed failure reports

### Manual Testing

```bash
# Unit tests
pnpm run test:unit

# Integration tests (requires PostgreSQL and Redis)
pnpm run test:integration

# E2E tests
pnpm run test:e2e

# Test coverage
pnpm run test:coverage
```

### Load Testing

```bash
# Using k6
k6 run scripts/load-test.js

# Or using Artillery
artillery run scripts/load-test.yml
```

# CloudWatch logs
aws logs tail /aws/eks/invoice-saas-prod/application --follow
```

### Metrics

Key metrics monitored:
- API response times (p50, p95, p99)
- Error rates (4xx, 5xx)
- Database query performance
- Cache hit rates
- Queue depths
- Resource utilization

### Alarms

Critical alarms configured for:
- High error rates (>5%)
- Slow response times (p95 >1s)

## 💰 Cost Analysis

### Monthly Cost Breakdown

| Category | Cost | Optimized Cost |
|----------|------|----------------|
| **Compute (EKS)** | $467 | $280 (with Spot) |
| **Database (RDS)** | $438 | $253 (with RI) |
| **Cache (Redis)** | $657 | $357 (with RI) |
| **Networking** | $165 | $100 |
| **Storage** | $121 | $99 |
| **Other** | $90 | $90 |
| **Total** | **~$1,938** | **~$1,179** |

**Annual Budget**: ~$14,148 (optimized) / ~$23,256 (unoptimized)

**Detailed Analysis**: See [docs/COST_ANALYSIS.md](docs/COST_ANALYSIS.md)

### Cost Optimization

- Use Spot Instances for 70% of workload (42% savings)
- Purchase Reserved Instances for RDS/Redis (40-45% savings)
- Implement S3 lifecycle policies (30% savings on storage)
- Use VPC endpoints to reduce NAT costs (20% savings)

- ✅ **Monitoring**: CloudWatch integration
- ✅ **Documentation**: Complete

## 📊 Advanced Analytics Dashboard

The application now includes an interactive Advanced Analytics Dashboard in the web app with:

- KPI cards: Total Users, Total Revenue, Conversion Rate, Avg. Session Duration
- Time series: Daily Active Users with 7-day moving average and anomaly detection
- Revenue breakdown: Aggregated revenue by channel
- Device distribution: Donut chart of Desktop, Mobile, and Tablet traffic
- Conversion funnel: Visits ➜ Product View ➜ Add to Cart ➜ Checkout ➜ Purchase
- Cohort analysis: Weekly retention heatmap across 12 cohorts and 8 weeks

How to use:

1. Start the web app (see Quick Start above):
   - pnpm dev (from the repo root) or pnpm --filter web dev (from apps/web)
2. Open the browser to http://localhost:3000/analytics
3. Use filters to slice data by date range, channels, and devices. The charts update instantly.

Notes:
- Data is synthetic and generated deterministically for consistent demos. No backend is required.
- The dashboard runs client-side and loads Apache ECharts via CDN for rich visualizations.
- The page is responsive and adapts from mobile to wide desktop breakpoints.

Additional docs: See docs/ANALYTICS_DASHBOARD.md for architecture, configuration, and extension tips.
