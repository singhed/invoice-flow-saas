# Invoice Flow SaaS

A modern, extensible invoicing platform intended to help businesses automate client billing, payment tracking, and recurring invoice workflows. This repository currently contains the initial project documentation; source code and infrastructure are introduced incrementally as the platform evolves.

## Project Status

> **Phase:** Planning & documentation

The codebase is in its bootstrap phase. Each ticket on this project should introduce focused, reviewable changes (features, tests, infrastructure, or docs). This README explains the intended direction so contributors share a common picture before implementation lands.

## Project Vision

Invoice Flow SaaS targets product teams that need a reliable billing back office without building everything from scratch. The platform is designed to:

- Centralize client and contract records
- Generate, schedule, and deliver invoices automatically
- Collect payments through third-party processors
- Provide dashboards and analytics for finance teams
- Integrate with accounting software via webhooks and APIs

## Feature Highlights

Planned feature areas include:

- **Invoice lifecycle management** – draft, approve, send, and archive invoices.
- **Automation rules** – create recurring billing schedules and automate reminders.
- **Payment processing** – connect with payment gateways to collect invoices online.
- **Customer portal** – allow clients to view invoices, update payment methods, and download receipts.
- **Reporting & analytics** – summarize revenue, aging invoices, and payment status.
- **Integrations** – sync data to accounting tools (e.g., QuickBooks, Xero) and CRM systems.

## Planned System Architecture

Although implementation is still pending, the high-level architecture is expected to follow a modular, service-oriented layout:

1. **Web application / dashboard** – A modern SPA for finance teams to manage invoices and view analytics.
2. **Public API** – REST (and potentially GraphQL) endpoints enabling programmatic access and integrations.
3. **Background workers** – Queue-driven jobs for invoice generation, email delivery, and payment reconciliation.
4. **Data layer** – A relational database for transactional data plus optional caches for performance.
5. **Infrastructure** – Infrastructure-as-code definitions for provisioning (cloud provider TBD), CI/CD pipelines, and observability.

As the codebase matures, this section will be updated with concrete implementation details.

## Getting Started

Even though there is no runnable application yet, the steps below outline how new contributors should prepare once the scaffolding lands.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed locally:

- Git >= 2.37
- Node.js >= 18 (proposed frontend/backend runtime)
- npm, pnpm, or yarn (package manager of choice)
- Docker & Docker Compose (for local databases and third-party services)

Additional tooling (TypeScript, Go, Python, etc.) will be listed here as the stack solidifies.

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
$ git clone https://github.com/singhed/invoice-flow-saas.git
$ cd invoice-flow-saas

# Checkout the active development branch
$ git checkout main

# Install dependencies (command will be confirmed once the package manager is chosen)
$ npm install
```

### Environment Variables

Configuration will be driven by environment variables. Once services are implemented, create a `.env` file (or use a dedicated secrets manager) containing variables such as:

```
DATABASE_URL=
REDIS_URL=
STRIPE_API_KEY=
SENDGRID_API_KEY=
SESSION_SECRET=
```

A `.env.example` file will be added when the first service lands to document which keys are required.

### Database & External Services

Local development will likely rely on containerized services. Example (subject to change):

- PostgreSQL for transactional data
- Redis for caching and background jobs
- Stripe or Paddle for payment processing
- An email provider (e.g., SendGrid) for notifications

Once defined, run `docker compose up` (or the equivalent script) to start dependencies before booting the app.

### Running the Application

The exact command (e.g., `npm run dev`, `pnpm dev`, `make dev`) will be documented after the application scaffold is merged. Until then, follow ticket instructions for manual testing or proof-of-concept scripts.

### Running Tests

Testing strategy will be layered:

- Unit tests for isolated business logic
- Integration tests covering API endpoints and data access
- End-to-end tests for critical workflows (invoice creation, payment collection, etc.)

Scripts (e.g., `npm test`, `pnpm test`, or `make test`) will be added once tooling is in place. Contributors should ensure all tests pass before opening a pull request.

## Project Structure

When implementation begins, expect a layout similar to:

```
invoice-flow-saas/
├─ apps/
│  ├─ web/              # Frontend application (Next.js / React)
│  └─ api/              # Backend API (Node.js / NestJS / Express)
├─ packages/
│  ├─ ui/               # Shared UI component library
│  └─ config/           # Shared configuration modules
├─ infra/               # Infrastructure-as-code (Terraform, Pulumi, etc.)
├─ scripts/             # Automation and developer tooling scripts
├─ docs/                # Additional documentation
└─ README.md            # You are here
```

The actual directory structure may differ; update this section as the repository takes shape.

## Development Workflow

1. Create a descriptive branch from `main` (e.g., `feature/invoice-builder`).
2. Keep changes scoped to a single concern and include tests/documentation.
3. Run linters, formatters, and tests locally before opening a PR.
4. Open a pull request referencing the related ticket, request review, and address feedback promptly.
5. Once all checks pass and reviews are approved, merge via the standard workflow.

Automation (CI/CD, linting, formatting) will be configured in future iterations.

## Contributing

- Fork the repository and create feature branches for your changes.
- Follow the coding standards defined in the project (will be documented as the stack lands).
- Provide clear commit messages and include screenshots or recordings for UI changes when relevant.
- Update documentation and add tests alongside your code.

## License

The licensing model for Invoice Flow SaaS has not been finalized. A LICENSE file will be added before the first public release. Until then, all rights are reserved by the repository owner.

## Support

For questions, feature requests, or bug reports:

- Open an issue with as much context as possible (problem statement, reproduction steps, expected outcome).
- Use the repository discussions or contact the maintainers directly if the issue is sensitive.
