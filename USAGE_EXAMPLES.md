## Audit Trail Example

When you create an expense with AI suggestions:

1. **Initial State**:
   - Expense created with description and amount
   - AI suggestion stored with `was_accepted: false`
   - Expense has no category/notes yet

2. **User Reviews**:
   - User sees AI suggestions in UI
   - Can accept, modify, or ignore

3. **User Accepts**:
   - Click "Accept AI Suggestions"
   - Expense updated with suggested values
   - AI suggestion updated: `was_accepted: true`
   - Audit trail shows: Original suggestion + final values match

4. **User Modifies**:
   - User changes category or notes
   - Expense updated with custom values
   - AI suggestion updated: `was_accepted: true`, `user_modified: true`
   - Audit trail shows: Original AI suggestion + user's modifications

This ensures complete transparency for compliance and auditing purposes.
