## Immediate Action Required

### Step 1: Do NOT Deploy Current Code to Production
The current codebase has multiple critical vulnerabilities that could lead to:
- Complete authentication bypass
- Full database compromise
- Host system takeover
- User credential theft

### Step 2: Implement Critical Fixes (Week 1)
Focus on the 6 critical vulnerabilities first:

```bash
# 1. Generate strong secrets
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"

# 2. Set environment variables
export JWT_SECRET="<generated-secret>"
export REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET="<generated-secret>"
export ALLOWED_ORIGINS="https://yourdomain.com"

# 3. Remove hardcoded credentials
# Edit: services/user-service/src/index.ts
# Edit: services/api-gateway/src/middleware/auth.ts
# Edit: docker-compose.yml
# Delete: infrastructure/kubernetes/base/secrets.yaml

# 4. Test changes
pnpm test
pnpm test:e2e
```

### Step 3: Implement High Priority Fixes (Weeks 2-4)
Address the 7 high-priority vulnerabilities:
- Strengthen password policy
- Increase bcrypt rounds
- Add rate limiting everywhere
- Implement Redis session storage
- Add security logging
- Protect API documentation
- Add input sanitization

### Step 4: Complete Medium & Low Priority Fixes (Month 2)
- Fix CSRF token validation
- Enforce HTTPS
- Improve filename sanitization
- Configure security headers properly
- Reduce error message verbosity

### Step 5: Implement Long-term Security Measures
- Set up AWS Secrets Manager
- Implement External Secrets Operator for Kubernetes
- Add dependency scanning to CI/CD
- Implement security monitoring and alerting
- Regular penetration testing
- Security training for development team

## Tools & Commands for Security

### Generate Secure Secrets
```bash
# JWT secrets (256-bit)
openssl rand -hex 32

# Database password (base64)
openssl rand -base64 32

# API keys
openssl rand -hex 64
```

### Scan for Vulnerabilities
```bash
# Node.js dependencies
pnpm audit
npm audit fix

# Find hardcoded secrets
grep -r "password\|secret\|key" --include="*.ts" --include="*.js" . | grep -v "node_modules"

# Docker image scanning
docker scan <image-name>

# Git history secrets scan
git log --all --full-history --source -- *secret* *password*
```

### Test Security Fixes
```bash
# Test CORS
curl -H "Origin: http://evil.com" -I http://localhost:3000/api/auth/login

# Test rate limiting
for i in {1..70}; do curl http://localhost:3000/health; done

# Test authentication
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer invalid-token" http://localhost:3000/api/users

# Test input validation
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"weak"}'
```

- [ ] ALLOWED_ORIGINS is explicitly configured (no wildcards)
- [ ] All database credentials are strong and unique
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets in code or config files
- [ ] All secrets stored in proper secret management system
- [ ] Environment variables validated on application startup

### Authentication & Authorization
- [ ] Password policy requires 12+ characters with complexity
- [ ] Bcrypt rounds set to 12 or higher
- [ ] Access tokens stored in httpOnly cookies
- [ ] Refresh token rotation implemented
- [ ] Failed login attempts logged and monitored
- [ ] Account lockout after multiple failed attempts

### Network Security
