## Cost Optimization Strategies

### 1. Compute Optimization (Potential Savings: 50-60%)

#### A. Spot Instances for EKS
**Current**: 100% on-demand nodes
**Optimized**: 70% spot, 30% on-demand
**Savings**: ~$600/month

```hcl
# Terraform configuration
resource "aws_eks_node_group" "spot" {
  capacity_type = "SPOT"
  instance_types = ["t3.large", "t3a.large", "t2.large"]
  
  scaling_config {
    desired_size = 8
    max_size     = 12
    min_size     = 5
  }
}
```

#### B. Reserved Instances for RDS
**Current**: On-demand pricing
**Optimized**: 1-year All Upfront Reserved Instance
**Savings**: 42% (~$185/month)

```bash
aws rds purchase-reserved-db-instances-offering \
  --reserved-db-instances-offering-id <offering-id> \
  --db-instance-count 2
```

#### C. ElastiCache Reserved Nodes
**Current**: On-demand pricing
**Optimized**: 1-year All Upfront Reserved
**Savings**: 46% (~$300/month)

### 2. NAT Gateway Optimization (Potential Savings: 33%)

**Current**: 3 NAT Gateways ($98/month + data)
**Optimized**: 1 NAT Gateway with fault tolerance trade-off
**Savings**: ~$65/month

**Alternative**: NAT Instances (t3.small)
**Savings**: ~$85/month
**Trade-off**: Manual management required

```bash
# For production, consider keeping 3 NATs but monitor usage
# Use VPC endpoints for AWS services to reduce NAT traffic
```

### 3. Storage Optimization (Potential Savings: 30%)

#### S3 Lifecycle Policies
```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket_lifecycle_configuration" "invoices" {
  rule {
    id     = "transition-old-invoices"
    status = "Enabled"
    
    transition {
      days          = 90
      storage_class = "STANDARD_IA"  # 50% cheaper
    }
    
    transition {
      days          = 180
      storage_class = "GLACIER"  # 85% cheaper
    }
    
    expiration {
      days = 2555  # 7 years (legal requirement)
    }
  }
}
```

**Savings**: ~$15/month

#### RDS Storage Auto-scaling
Monitor and right-size based on actual usage. Start with 50GB if sufficient.
**Savings**: ~$7/month

### 4. CloudWatch Log Optimization (Potential Savings: 40%)

**Current**: 7-day retention for all logs
**Optimized**: Tiered retention policy

```hcl
resource "aws_cloudwatch_log_group" "application" {
  retention_in_days = 3  # Application logs
}

resource "aws_cloudwatch_log_group" "audit" {
  retention_in_days = 90  # Audit logs
}
```

**Savings**: ~$10/month

### 5. Right-sizing Based on Usage (Potential Savings: 20-30%)

#### After 1 Month of Production
- Analyze CloudWatch metrics
- Identify under-utilized resources
- Downgrade instance types if possible

**Example Optimizations**:
- RDS: db.r6g.large → db.t4g.large ($175/month savings)
- Redis: cache.r6g.large → cache.t4g.medium ($400/month savings)
- EKS nodes: Reduce minimum from 3 to 2 ($62/month savings)

### 6. Auto-scaling Optimization

#### Aggressive Scale-Down During Off-Hours
```yaml
# Kubernetes HPA with scale-down to minimum during low traffic
spec:
  behavior:
    scaleDown:
      stabilizationWindowSeconds: 60
      policies:
      - type: Percent
        value: 50
        periodSeconds: 60
```

**Potential Savings**: 15-20% during off-peak hours

### 7. Data Transfer Optimization (Potential Savings: 30%)

#### CloudFront for S3 Content
Add CloudFront CDN in front of S3 for invoice downloads
- Reduces S3 data transfer costs
- Improves performance globally
**Savings**: ~$15/month

#### VPC Endpoints
Use VPC endpoints for S3, SQS, SNS to avoid NAT gateway charges
**Savings**: ~$10/month in data processing

## Budget Monitoring and Alerts

### AWS Budgets Configuration

```bash
aws budgets create-budget \
  --account-id <account-id> \
  --budget file://budget.json \
  --notifications-with-subscribers file://notifications.json
```

**budget.json**:
```json
{
  "BudgetName": "InvoiceSaaSMonthlyBudget",
  "BudgetLimit": {
    "Amount": "1500",
    "Unit": "USD"
  },
  "TimeUnit": "MONTHLY",
  "BudgetType": "COST"
}
```

### CloudWatch Cost Anomaly Detection

Enable AWS Cost Anomaly Detection for automatic alerts on unusual spending.

---

## Cost Allocation Tags

Implement comprehensive tagging strategy:

```hcl
tags = {
  Project     = "invoice-saas"
  Environment = "production"
  Component   = "compute"
  CostCenter  = "engineering"
  ManagedBy   = "terraform"
}
```

Track costs by:
- Service (invoice, payment, notification)
- Environment (dev, staging, prod)
- Component (compute, storage, networking)

---

## Scaling Budget with Usage

### Usage Tiers

| Monthly Active Users | Estimated Cost | Cost per User |
|---------------------|----------------|---------------|
| 0-1,000 | $1,306 | $1.31 |
| 1,000-10,000 | $2,500 | $0.25 |
| 10,000-50,000 | $5,000 | $0.10 |
| 50,000-100,000 | $8,000 | $0.08 |
| 100,000+ | $12,000+ | $0.06 |

### Revenue Requirements

To achieve profitability with optimized costs:

**Break-even Pricing**:
- At 1,000 users: $1.31/user/month + 100% margin = **$2.62/user**
- At 10,000 users: $0.25/user/month + 400% margin = **$1.00/user**
- At 50,000 users: $0.10/user/month + 900% margin = **$0.90/user**

**Target Pricing**: $9.99/user/month
**Break-even**: ~130 paying users

## Emergency Cost Reduction

If immediate cost reduction is needed:

1. **Scale down EKS nodes** (30% savings immediately)
   ```bash
   kubectl scale deployment --all --replicas=1 -n invoice-saas
   ```

2. **Switch to smaller DB instances** (40% savings)
   ```bash
   aws rds modify-db-instance --db-instance-identifier invoice-saas-prod \
     --db-instance-class db.t4g.large --apply-immediately
   ```

3. **Reduce Redis cluster size** (50% savings)
   ```bash
   aws elasticache modify-replication-group \
     --replication-group-id invoice-saas-prod-redis \
     --num-cache-clusters 2
   ```

4. **Suspend non-critical services** (20% savings)
   ```bash
   kubectl scale deployment notification-service --replicas=0 -n invoice-saas
   ```

## Conclusion

With aggressive optimization, the invoice SaaS platform can operate at approximately **$1,300-1,500/month** (~$15,600-18,000/year), comfortably within the $20,000 budget while maintaining production-grade reliability and performance.

Key success factors:
- Utilize spot instances for non-critical workloads
- Purchase reserved instances for predictable workloads
- Implement comprehensive auto-scaling
- Monitor and optimize continuously
- Right-size resources based on actual usage data
